This repository contains three data science projects:

Titanic Survival Prediction: This project predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on features like age, sex, ticket class, and more. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle's Titanic competition.

Iris Flower Species Prediction: Here, we use the famous Iris flower dataset to train a model to classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements.

Credit Card Fraud Detection: This project focuses on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle and contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
Each project includes Jupyter notebooks (*.ipynb) that walk through the data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction phases. Additionally, the repository includes the datasets used in each project.

Feel free to explore the notebooks and datasets to understand the data science methodologies and techniques used in these projects.
